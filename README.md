I've set this page up mostly out of curiosity. 

Here are some projects of mine:

### [Textbooks Abridged](https://jwd-999.github.io/Textbooks-Abridged/)

This is my most active personal project at the moment. It's what it says on the tin. My idea is to writeup only the results of a math text as a means of quick reference. 

### [My private RSS feed](https://jwd-999.github.io/RSS/)

This just allows me to listen to audio files in my preferred podcast player [pocketcasts](https://pocketcasts.com/).

### [pages-test](https://jwd-999.github.io/pages-test/)

I am using this page to figure out how to do various things with github pages without screwing up my other pages
